# Learning Bash Scripting

The tasks are mostly taken from [here](https://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/advanced_bash_scripting_guide/writingscripts.html).  This repositiory contains some the task descriptions and scripts used for practise, that i'm using to improve my skills in bash scripting. 

### rec_list 
Perform a recursive directory listing on the current directory and save the information to a file. Compress the file, and save the file, in a directory which is taken as input from the user.

### line_spacing
Write a script that reads each line of a target file, then writes the line back to stdout, but with an extra blank line following. This has the effect of double-spacing the file.
Include all necessary code to check whether the script gets the necessary command line argument (a filename), and whether the specified file exists. When it workds modify it to triple space a file.

Write an adiitional function that removed all the lines that are blank or contain only white spaces. 

### backwards
Write a script that echoes itself to stdout, but backwards.
