Contains the more useful scripts that i use often.

### auto_venv 
This script automatically activates a virtual environment on cd'ing to a directory that contains a virtual environment. It keeps the virtual envionment activated on cd'ing to subdirectories of the directory containing the virtul envionment. However, if one cd's outside the directory it deactivates the virtual envionment and checks to activate a different virtual envionment in the new directory. 

### recursively_delete_files
Recursively deleted files of all subdirectories with a directory, keeping the directory structure alive, and asks for an extended confirmation before carrying the task out.
